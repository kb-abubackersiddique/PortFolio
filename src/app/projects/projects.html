  <ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>💬 ChatGPT Clone</strong><br><small>Developed a simple chatbot that uses the OpenAI API to chat with users. The bot can answer questions and hold conversations like ChatGPT.</small></li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>🧠 Social Media Analyzer – Power BI Dashboard</strong><br><small>Created interactive dashboards in Power BI to analyze how people engage on social media — likes, comments, and shares. This helped visualize which posts performed best and identify audience trends.</small></li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>🌾 Wheat Disease Detection  – YOLO Model</strong><br><small>Built a machine learning model using YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect and classify diseases in wheat crops from images. This helps farmers identify problems early and improve yield.</small></li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>🎓 AI-Personalized Learning Platform</strong><br><small>Designed a web app that suggests study materials to students based on their performance. It uses basic AI logic to recommend what topics they should focus on next.</small></li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>🛒 E-Commerce Website (Angular + Spring Boot+ MySQL)</strong><br><small>Developed a web-based shopping application using Angular for the front end, Spring Boot for the backend, and MySQL for the database. Users can view products, add items to the cart, and place orders. This project helped me understand full-stack development and API integration.</small></li>
     <li class="list-group-item"><strong>😴 Driver Drowsiness Detection (Machine Learning & OpenCV)</strong><br><small>Built a system that detects if a driver is feeling sleepy using real-time webcam video. The model analyzes eye movements and alerts the driver when signs of drowsiness are found. It improves road safety using computer vision and Python.</small></li>
